1. Write a program that takes co-eeficents of quadratic equations for form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and prints the roots of equation. If the roots of equation are euqal then it prints
   roots are equal as show below.
   
   Example exections:
   
   Enter a, b, and c in same ordder : 1, -7, 12
   Root 1 : 3
   Root 2 : 4
   
    Enter a, b, and c in same ordder : 1, -1, 1
    Root 1 and 2 and equal : 1
